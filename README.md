# recursive-prototyping
Code supporting our ICPR 2026 paper submission: "Recursive Prototyping for Computational Behavior Analysis from Egocentric Videos". This repository provides the implementation of a framework for constructing interpretable symbolic representations of egocentric video captured during procedural tasks. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.
